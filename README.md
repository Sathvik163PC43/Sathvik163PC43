## ðŸš€ Projects

1. **Early Detection of Plant Disease using OpenCV**
     Aim:We have to detect disease early from plants
    â€¢First We understood the case study and downloaded the dataset
    â€¢After that we have separated the dataset into train and valid
    â€¢After that we have done eda on train and valid datasets
    â€¢After that we built the model by using CNN and vgg-16
    â€¢After that again we rebuilt the model transfer learning using vgg-16
    â€¢After that we have tuned the model and got accuracy 94.04%
   - Tools: Python,tensorflow,keras,vggnet,opencv,CNN

3. **Analysis on Apartment Price Based On BHKs,CarpetArea,PerSqft and OtherFactors**
   AIM: How to buy a house based on bhk, price,carpetarea,per_sqft,city,area on basis of client
   â€¢Extracted the Raw data from MagicBricks Website By Using Data Extraction Techniques like BeautifulSoup, Regex
   â€¢Cleaned the Data using Python Libraries and create dataframe by using Data Cleaning techniques like Numpy, Pandas
   â€¢Visualized the data by using Data Visualization techniques like Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Tools: Python,BeautifulSoap,Regex,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlin,Seaborn.
